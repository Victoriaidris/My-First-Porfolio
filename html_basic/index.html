            <h1>Seeing the world from different lenses</h1>
            <h2>What is the world?</h2>
            <p>The world is where we live in that is created by God.</p>
            <h3>Lenses</h3>
            <p>The lens you use to view the world comes from the way you have perceived the world and most times your belief.</p>
            <h4>The lens of an average Nigerian</h4>
            <p>A Nigerian sees the world as beautiful only through fantasy because of what we have been exposed to as a people.</p>
            <p>We define the world as beautiful but only according to what our status has exposed us to.</p>
